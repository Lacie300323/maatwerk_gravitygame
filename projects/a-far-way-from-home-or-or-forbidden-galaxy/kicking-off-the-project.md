# Kicking off the project

## **Brainstorming Session**

To come up with a game concept for this project, I used a **simple ideation technique**. This ideation technique has two paths. **The first path is to visualize the game in either a different dimension or perspective.** **The second way you can go about this, is to imagine how the game feel would change if you took away or added several other key mechanics**. I applied this technique by researching several of my favorite games and games I found interesting, making a list of the components I liked and didnâ€™t like. I then used the ideation technique to **brainstorm for game concepts**. You can find the brainstorm session document in the link down below.

## **Project Initiation Document \|\| Nano PID**

Before starting on the game project, I made a Project Initiation Document or PID. This would help me set up the foundation of my project and guide me through my process. This will also be used as reference point for my student coach and accessors. You can find this PID in the link below.
